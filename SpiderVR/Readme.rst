The codes presented here are examples for the code for all feature sets and labels used in the manuscript. 
We simply changed the feature sets or labels. As described in the method section of the manuscript, the pipelines themselves were not changed 
(i.e. all "static" RS prediction pipelines were identical to each other, as were all "combined")
